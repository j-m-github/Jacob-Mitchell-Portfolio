I developed a full stack web application called FOOD utilizing Flask, Python, SQLite, and Jinja. The purpose of FOOD is to help users decide what and/or where to eat based off of their cravings. Users populate and tie together their own database of restaurants and dishes with descriptors, which is then organized into an interactive dashboard that narrows down available restaurants and dishes based off of user selections.
