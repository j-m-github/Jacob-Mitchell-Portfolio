# [FOOD: A Full Stack Web Application](https://github.com/j-m-github/CS50x-final-project) - [**(Video)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAoQFMFd43c)

I developed a full stack web application called FOOD utilizing Flask, Python, SQLite, and Jinja. The purpose of FOOD is to help users decide what and/or where to eat based off of their cravings. Users populate and tie together their own database of restaurants and dishes with descriptors, which is then organized into an interactive dashboard that narrows down available restaurants and dishes based off of user selections.

I wrote fibonacci.c in C while taking CS50x to wrap my head around recursive functions. I was familiar with the Fibonacci sequence and realized it would be a straightforward concept in which to utilize recursion. I rewrote the program for Python as well.
