# [FOOD: A Full Stack Web Application](https://github.com/j-m-github/CS50x-final-project) - [(Video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAoQFMFd43c)
I developed a full stack web application utilizing Flask, Python, SQLite, and Jinja called FOOD. The purpose of FOOD is to allow users to help them decide what and/or where to eat based off of their cravings. Users populate and tie together their own database of restaurants and dishes with descriptors, which is then organized into an interactive dashboard that narrows down available restaurants and dishes based off of user selections.
